   <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
   <ol type="1">
    <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
    <li>CSS described how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen ,paper or in other media.</li><br>
    <li><span class="item-1">CSS is not necessary</span><span class="item-2"> CSS saves a lot of work</span> can control a layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
    <li id="item-3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li><br>
   </ol>
   <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
    <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
    <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However<span id="item-4"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID on the other hand applies a style to one unique element.ID is also specialis that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it is used by JavaScript</p>
   <p>In CSS,selector are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,astyle or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
   <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
